      <h1>Trends in Solid Waste Management</h1>
      <p>
        The world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste
        annually, with at least 33 percent of that—extremely conservatively—not
        managed in an environmentally safe manner. Worldwide, waste generated
        per person per day averages 0.74 kilogram but ranges widely, from 0.11
        to 4.54 kilograms. Though they only account for 16 percent of the
        world’s population, high-income countries generate about 34 percent, or
        683 million tonnes, of the world’s waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        When looking forward, global waste is expected to grow to 3.40 billion
        tonnes by 2050, more than double population growth over the same period.
        Overall, there is a positive correlation between waste generation and
        income level. Daily per capita waste generation in high-income countries
        is projected to increase by 19 percent by 2050, compared to low- and
        middle-income countries where it is expected to increase by
        approximately 40% or more. Waste generation initially decreases at the
        lowest income levels and then increases at a faster rate for incremental
        income changes at low income levels than at high income levels. The
        total quantity of waste generated in low-income countries is expected to
        increase by more than three times by 2050. The East Asia and Pacific
        region is generating most of the world’s waste, at 23 percent, and the
        Middle East and North Africa region is producing the least in absolute
        terms, at 6 percent. However, the fastest growing regions are
        Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa,
        where, by 2050, total waste generation is expected to more than triple,
        double, and double respectively. In these regions, more than half of
        waste is currently openly dumped, and the trajectories of waste growth
        will have vast implications for the environment, health, and prosperity,
        thus requiring urgent action.
      </p>
      <!-- <h3>Projected waste generation, by region (millions of tonnes/year)</h3> -->
      <p>
        Waste collection is a critical step in managing waste, yet rates vary
        largely by income levels, with upper-middle- and high-income countries
        providing nearly universal waste collection. Low-income countries
        collect about 48 percent of waste in cities, but this proportion drops
        drastically to 26 percent outside of urban areas. Across regions,
        Sub-Saharan Africa collects about 44 percent of waste while Europe and
        Central Asia and North America collect at least 90 percent of waste.
      </p>
      <h3>Waste collection rates, by income level (percent)</h3>
      <img src="./Assets/pie-2.png" alt="Graph" />
      <p>
        Waste composition differs across income levels, reflecting varied
        patterns of consumption. High-income countries generate relatively less
        food and green waste, at 32 percent of total waste, and generate more
        dry waste that could be recycled, including plastic, paper, cardboard,
        metal, and glass, which account for 51 percent of waste. Middle- and
        low-income countries generate 53 percent and 57 percent food and green
        waste, respectively, with the fraction of organic waste increasing as
        economic development levels decrease. In low-income countries, materials
        that could be recycled account for only 20 percent of the waste stream.
        Across regions, there is not much variety within waste streams beyond
        those aligned with income. All regions generate about 50 percent or more
        organic waste, on average, except for Europe and Central Asia and North
        America, which generate higher portions of dry waste.
      </p>
      <h3>Global waste composition (percent)</h3>
      <img src="./Assets/pie-1.png" alt="Graph" />
      <p>
        It is a frequent misconception that technology is the solution to the
        problem of unmanaged and increasing waste. Technology is not a panacea
        and is usually only one factor to consider when managing solid waste.
        Countries that advance from open dumping and other rudimentary waste
        management methods are more likely to succeed when they select locally
        appropriate solutions. Globally, most waste is currently dumped or
        disposed of in some form of a landfill. Some 37 percent of waste is
        disposed of in some form of a landfill, 8 percent of which is disposed
        of in sanitary landfills with landfill gas collection systems. Open
        dumping accounts for about 31 percent of waste, 19 percent is recovered
        through recycling and composting, and 11 percent is incinerated for
        final disposal. Adequate waste disposal or treatment, such as controlled
        landfills or more stringently operated facilities, is almost exclusively
        the domain of high- and upper-middle-income countries. Lower-income
        countries generally rely on open dumping; 93 percent of waste is dumped
        in low-income countries and only 2 percent in high-income countries.
        Three regions openly dump more than half of their waste—the Middle East
        and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.
        Upper-middle-income countries have the highest percentage of waste in
        landfills, at 54 percent. This rate decreases in high-income countries
        to 39 percent, with diversion of 36 percent of waste to recycling and
        composting and 22 percent to incineration. Incineration is used
        primarily in high-capacity, high-income, and land-constrained countries.
      </p>
      <h3>Global treatment and disposal of waste (percent)</h3>
      <img src="./Assets/pie-3.png" alt="Graph" />
      <p>
        Based on the volume of waste generated, its composition, and how it is
        managed, it is estimated that 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2)
        equivalent greenhouse gas emissions were generated from solid waste
        treatment and disposal in 2016, or 5 percent of global emissions. This
        is driven primarily by disposing of waste in open dumps and landfills
        without landfill gas collection systems. Food waste accounts for nearly
        50% of emissions. Solid waste–related emissions are anticipated to
        increase to 2.38 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year by 2050 if no
        improvements are made in the sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most countries, solid waste management operations are typically a
        local responsibility, and nearly 70 percent of countries have
        established institutions with responsibility for policy development and
        regulatory oversight in the waste sector. About two-thirds of countries
        have created targeted legislation and regulations for solid waste
        management, though enforcement varies drastically. Direct central
        government involvement in waste service provision, other than regulatory
        oversight or fiscal transfers, is uncommon, with about 70 percent of
        waste services being overseen directly by local public entities. At
        least half of services, from primary waste collection through treatment
        and disposal, are operated by public entities and about one-third
        involve a public-private partnership. However, successful partnerships
        with the private sector for financing and operations tend to succeed
        only under certain conditions with appropriate incentive structures and
        enforcement mechanisms, and therefore they are not always the ideal
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financing solid waste management systems is a significant challenge,
        even more so for ongoing operational costs than for capital investments,
        and operational costs need to be taken into account upfront. In
        high-income countries, operating costs for integrated waste management,
        including col-lection, transport, treatment, and disposal, generally
        exceed $100 per tonne. Lower-income countries spend less on waste
        operations in absolute terms, with costs of about $35 per tonne and
        sometimes higher, but these countries experience much more difficulty in
        recovering costs. Waste management is labor intensive and costs of
        transportation alone are in the range of $20–$50 per tonne. Cost
        recovery for waste services differs drastically across income levels.
        User fees range from an average of $35 per year in low-income countries
        to $170 per year in high-income countries, with full or nearly full cost
        recovery being largely limited to high-income countries. User fee models
        may be fixed or variable based on the type of user being billed.
        Typically, local governments cover about 50 percent of investment costs
        for waste systems, and the remainder comes mainly from national
        government subsidies and the private sector.

            Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)—more commonly known as trash or
            garbage—consists of everyday items we use and then throw away, such
            as product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, bottles,
            food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint, and batteries.

            Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a pool of various solid wastes by
            towns and cities from different types of household activities. It
            may include biodegradable waste, electrical and electronic waste,
            and composite waste such as clothing, hazardous waste (paints,
            spray, and chemicals), and medical waste.

      <h1>Trends in Industrial Waste Management</h1>
      <p>
        Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which
        includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing
        process such as that of factories, mills, and mining operations. Types
        of industrial waste include dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete, scrap
        metal, oil, solvents, chemicals, scrap lumber, even vegetable matter
        from restaurants. Industrial waste may be solid, semi-solid or liquid in
        form. It may be hazardous waste (some types of which are toxic) or
        non-hazardous waste. Industrial waste may pollute the nearby soil or
        adjacent water bodies, and can contaminate groundwater, lakes, streams,
        rivers or coastal waters. Industrial waste is often mixed into municipal
        waste, making accurate assessments difficult. An estimate for the US
        goes as high as 7.6 billion tons of industrial waste produced annually,
        as of 2017. Most countries have enacted legislation to deal with the
        problem of industrial waste, but strictness and compliance regimes vary.
        Enforcement is always an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        When looking forward, global waste is expected to grow to 3.40 billion
        tonnes by 2050, more than double population growth over the same period.
        Overall, there is a positive correlation between waste generation and
        income level. Daily per capita waste generation in high-income countries
        is projected to increase by 19 percent by 2050, compared to low- and
        middle-income countries where it is expected to increase by
        approximately 40% or more. Waste generation initially decreases at the
        lowest income levels and then increases at a faster rate for incremental
        income changes at low income levels than at high income levels. The
        total quantity of waste generated in low-income countries is expected to
        increase by more than three times by 2050. The East Asia and Pacific
        region is generating most of the world’s waste, at 23 percent, and the
        Middle East and North Africa region is producing the least in absolute
        terms, at 6 percent. However, the fastest growing regions are
        Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa,
        where, by 2050, total waste generation is expected to more than triple,
        double, and double respectively. In these regions, more than half of
        waste is currently openly dumped, and the trajectories of waste growth
        will have vast implications for the environment, health, and prosperity,
        thus requiring urgent action.

      <h3>Classification of industrial waste and its treatment</h3>
      <img src="./Assets/igraph-1.png" alt="Graph" />
      <p>
        Hazardous waste, chemical waste, industrial solid waste and municipal
        solid waste are classifications of wastes used by governments in
        different countries. Sewage treatment plants can treat some industrial
        wastes, i.e. those consisting of conventional pollutants such as
        biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Industrial wastes containing toxic
        pollutants or high concentrations of other pollutants (such as ammonia)
        require specialized treatment systems.
      </p>
      <h3>Environmental impact</h3>
      <img
        src="./Assets/igraph-2.webp"
        style="background-color: rgb(246, 246, 246)"
        alt="Graph"
      />
      <p>
        Many factories and most power plants are located near bodies of water to
        obtain large amounts of water for manufacturing processes or for
        equipment cooling.[4] In the US, electric power plants are the largest
        water users. Other industries using large amounts of water are pulp and
        paper mills, chemical plants, iron and steel mills, petroleum
        refineries, food processing plants and aluminum smelters
      </p>
      <p>
        Many less-developed countries that are becoming industrialized do not
        yet have the resources or technology to dispose their wastes with
        minimal impacts on the environment.[6] Both untreated and partially
        treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of
        water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water
        directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on
        the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater
        can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those
        who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant. Metals
        and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the marine
        ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wastewater containing nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) often causes
        eutrophication which can kill off existing life in water bodies. A
        Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the
        highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a
        direct correlation to industrial wastewater discharges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thermal pollution—discharges of water at elevated temperature after
        being used for cooling—can also lead to polluted water. Elevated water
        temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food
        chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by
        new thermophilic species.
